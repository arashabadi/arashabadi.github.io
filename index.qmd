## Welcome!

I am a highly motivated PhD student in Lund and Randall labs at UAB, with growing experience in B cell biology in infection and regulatory T cell biology across cancer and obesity contexts. I'm actively building expertise in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, bioinformatics pipelines, and machine learning, with a strong interest in their application to vaccines and immunotherapy. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy solving complex scientific problems. Eager to contribute to innovative, interdisciplinary research while continuing to learn from leaders in the field.
