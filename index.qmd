## Welcome!

A highly motivated PhD student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with growing experience in B cell biology in infection and regulatory T cell biology across cancer and obesity contexts. I'm actively building expertise in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, bioinformatics pipelines, and machine learning, with a strong interest in their application to vaccines and immunotherapy.
